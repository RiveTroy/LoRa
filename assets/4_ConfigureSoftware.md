## Register the mDot with Senet and get identifiers
You'll need to register the mDot with Senet to get identifiers for the Arduino sketch.  First, go to the [Senet portal](https://portal.senetco.com/) and register your device by providing the device ID and nickname (similar to what you did with the NorAm mote). Next, click on the mDot name to open a webpage with the mDot's information and then follow these steps: 

1. Click on the gear to open the menu.
2. Click on `Device Edit` to reveal the `Device Setup/Edit` sub-menu.
3. Take note of `mDot_name`, the nickname you gave the mDot
4. Take note of `XXXX`, the last 4 digits of the ID number on the mDot
5. Take note of the Senet `App Key`, which is referred to as the `Network_key` in the Arduino sketch.
6. Take note of the Senet `Application` number, which is referred to as the `Network_ID` in the Arduino sketch.

## Arduino sketch
[![](button_LoRa_Arduino_sketch.png)](LoRa_Arduino_quickstart_April2016.ino?raw=true)  

**You must customize your Arduino code so that it works with your mDot**.  You'll need the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to configure [the LoRa-Arduino sketch](LoRa_Arduino_quickstart_April2016.ino?raw=true).  The code starting at Line 27 is a template for you to modify: 

```Arduino
// *** Select the current mDot **
// Update the mDot data below to reflect the name, network key, and network identifier your mDot(s) 
// You need to adjust the comments in the code to select the mDot you're currently using
/* AAA with ID ending in 11:22 */     const String mDot_name = "AAA"; const String Network_key =  "11:22:33:44:55:11:22:33:44:55:11:22:33:44:11:22"; const String Network_ID = "11:22:33:44:55"; 
/* BBB with ID ending in 33:44 */    // const String mDot_name = "BBB"; const String Network_key = "11:22:33:44:55:11:22:33:44:55:11:22:33:44:33:44"; const String Network_ID = "11:22:33:44:55"; 
/* CCC with ID ending in 55:66 */    // const String mDot_name = "CCC"; const String Network_key = "11:22:33:44:55:11:22:33:44:55:11:22:33:44:55:66"; const String Network_ID = "11:22:33:44:55"; 
```

Replace `AAA` with your mDot nickname, `11:22` with the last 4 digits of your mDot ID number, as well as the `Network_key` and `Network_ID` with your unique values from Senet.  Note that Senet provides the ID in the format `0x11,0x22,0x33,...` which you'll need to change to `11:22:33:...`.

This template assumes that you have three mDots (you're ambitious!) named `AAA`, `BBB` and `CCC` with ID numbers ending in `11:22`, `33:44` and `55:66`, respectively, since we found it useful to work with a few mDots.  If you've only got one mDot, then simply delete the lines for `BBB` and `CCC`. If you've got multiple mDots, then you can update `BBB` and `CCC` with your mDot information. When you run the sketch, you'll need to ensure that the code is commented with `//` so that only one mDot is selected at a time.  Be sure to save your customized file. 

*show cassis and how we labeled the mDot and tied the device # to the name*

We've commented the .ino file extensively so that you can understand how the code works.  In brief, in `setup()` the device sends AT commands to join the LoRa network and in `loop()` the device samples the sensors every 100ms and sends a LoRa data payload every 15 minutes.  The sketch gathers sensor data to demonstrate *LoRa* by monitoring activities:  

 1. `Click` Count how many times users click a button.  
 2. `Sound` Count how many times there's a loud noise.   
 3. `Light` Meausre the average light level.
