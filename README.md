# LoRa

These two files allow an Arduino to communicate via LoRa.  To reduce the dynamic memory of this sketch, reduce or remove the text in the Serial.print() statements.  The .ino file is for the Arduino.  The .bin file is for the Multitech mDot LoRa node. The sketch gathers sensor data to demonstrate *LoRa* by indicating activities in the kitchen: 
 1. Click. Users can choose to push a button. 
 2. Sound. The sound sensor triggers when people are talking or making lots of noise. 
 3. Light. The light sensor shows when the lights come on, i.e., working hours.
