# LoRa-Arduino quickstart project

![](assets/intro_img.png)

# Overview
###This project allows you to quickly try LoRa communications. 
**LoRa** is an exciting new technology for communicating at **Lo**ng **Ra**nge, low power, and low cost.  This project sends data from an Arduino Uno and a [Multitech mDot LoRa node](http://www.multitech.com/models/94557148LF) to the [Senet LoRa network](https://app.senetco.com/senetdev/login.aspx). Senet's JSON data payloads are converted by [Zapier](https://zapier.com) into data rows in a Google Spreadsheet. 

This project should take about an hour to complete, once you have the hardware.

This project was developed by the [Orange IoT Studio](http://orangeiotstudio.com/) to promote the consideration and adoption of LoRa. To that end, the IoT Studio is [supporting companies](http://orangeiotstudio.com/) interested in LoRa by giving out hardware kits and by funding co-development.

### LoRa is great for IoT
LoRa is an ideal communications technology for many internet-of-things (IoT) devices because **internet connectivity** is a key feature of IoT while also one of IoT devices' the biggest burdens.  Specifically, pairing devices with WiFi or Bluetooth is tedious; cellular connectivity is easy to implement and can transmit megabytes (MB) of data, but it's often not affordable for simple IoT devices. That's where LoRa comes in. For simple IoT devices that only need to send kilobytes (KB) of data or less, LoRa is an ideal solution.  

Public LoRa networks are being deployed world wide, including by [Orange in France](http://www.orange.com/en/Press-and-medias/press-releases-2016/press-releases-2015/Orange-deploys-a-network-for-the-Internet-of-Things). This project uses the [Senet LoRa network](https://app.senetco.com/senetdev/login.aspx) in North America since it was developed by the [Orange IoT Studio](http://orangeiotstudio.com/), part of [Orange Silicon Valley](http://orangesv.com/) in San Francisco.

### _Disclaimer_
_LoRa is a new technology and this project is in alpha, so it could break. If you're cool trying new things that aren't 100% reliable, proceed and have fun._   


## Get the hardware
You'll need to either purchase the equipment yourself or apply for a hardware kit from the IoT studio. 

### Apply for support from the IoT Studio
The IoT Studio is [supporting the developer community](http://orangeiotstudio.com/) to encourage use of LoRa.  You can apply for a free hardware kit containing the bill of materials, below. If you work for a company with a compelling use case, you can also apply for funded co-development.  The IoT Studio will be showcasing prototypes that demonstrate compelling LoRa use cases.


### Bill of Materials (BOM)

## Get the software

### Create your accounts
You'll need to create accounts with the following websites to get this project to work.  

### Senet
[Senet](https://app.senetco.com/senetdev/login.aspx) provides a public LoRa network in North America. They're contining to increase coverage around the United States, but there's a chance you might not have coverage at your workbench. 
You so you can use a NorAm mote to determine whether you have coverage in your area.  In some cases, there might only be LoRa coverage in certain parts of your building. 

### Zapier
[Zapier](https://zapier.com) automates the flow of data between Senet and Google Docs. For this project, we'll have Senet do an HTTP Post to a Zapier webhook. Zapier then puts the contents of Senet's JSON payload into a row in a Google Spreadsheet (gDocs). 

### Google Drive
You'll use [Google Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/) to view and analyze your data in this project.

### mDot firmware
[ ![](assets/button_mDot_firmware.png) ](assets/https://github.com/mikimer/LoRa/blob/master/assets/mDot_9600_baud.bin?raw=true)  
By default, the Multitech mDot is configured to communicate with AT commands at a 115200 baud rate. However, we found that errors happened between the mDot and the Arduino when they tried to communitacte that fast, so here's firmware with a slower 9600 baud rate, which works much better.  

### Arduino sketch
[ ![](assets/button_LoRa_Arduino_sketch.png) ](assets/LoRa_Arduino_quickstart_April2016/LoRa_Arduino_quickstart_April2016.ino?raw=true)  
This sketch was developed for an Arduino Uno on a MacBook to allow the Arduino to send data to the Multitech mDot using [AT commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_command_set).  You'll need the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to configure your code.

## Verify LoRa coverage 
[Senet](https://app.senetco.com/senetdev/login.aspx) provides a public LoRa network in North America. There's a chance you might not have coverage at your workbench, but that you do have coverage nearby. 

You can use a NorAm mote to determine where you have coverage.  In some cases


  
*Anna to make graphic of NorAm mote with GPS coming in and LoRa going out .*

*include photo of the NorAm mote*

*include link to sample gdoc w/ proper formulas from PDU to Lat/Long*

*include video with Mike explaining our NorAm mote*

   
## Configure the software

### mDot 
AT commands  
9600 baud  
Drag & Drop in MacBook. If Windows is different, please let us know how you loaded the mDot firmware and we'll update the instructions here. 

### Adruino Uno
You'll need the Arduino IDE. 

**You must customize your Arduino code so that it works with your mDot**

`/* AAA with ID ending in 11:22 */     const String mDot_name = "AAA"; const String Network_key =  "11:22:33:44:55:11:22:33:44:55:11:22:33:44:11:22"; const String Network_ID = "11:22:33:44:55";` 

*show cassis and how we labeled the mDot and tied the device # to the name*

These two files allow an Arduino to communicate via LoRa.  To reduce the dynamic memory of this sketch, reduce or remove the text in the Serial.print() statements.  The .ino file is for the Arduino.  The .bin file is for the Multitech mDot LoRa node. The sketch gathers sensor data to demonstrate *LoRa* by indicating activities in the kitchen: 
 1. Click. Count how many times users click a button. 
 2. Sound. Count how many times there's a loud noise.  
 3. Light. Meausre the average light level.
