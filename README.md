# LoRa

These two files allow an Arduino to communicate via LoRa.  To reduce the dynamic memory of this sketch, reduce or remove the text in the Serial.print() statements.  The .ino file is for the Arduino.  The .bin file is for the Multitech mDot LoRa node. The sketch gathers sensor data to demonstrate *LoRa* by indicating activities in the kitchen: 
 1. Click. Count how many times users click a button. 
 2. Sound. Count how many times there's a loud noise.  
 3. Light. Meausre the average light level.
