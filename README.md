# LoRa-Arduino quickstart project

_(Anna to insert cool image of sending data via LoRa here)_

# Overview
###This project allows you to quickly try LoRa. 
LoRa is an exciting new technology that enables **Lo**ng **Ra**nge, low power, low cost communciations.  

Public LoRa networks are being deployed world wide, including by [Orange in France](http://www.orange.com/en/Press-and-medias/press-releases-2016/press-releases-2015/Orange-deploys-a-network-for-the-Internet-of-Things). This


# Get Hardware

These two files allow an Arduino to communicate via LoRa.  To reduce the dynamic memory of this sketch, reduce or remove the text in the Serial.print() statements.  The .ino file is for the Arduino.  The .bin file is for the Multitech mDot LoRa node. The sketch gathers sensor data to demonstrate *LoRa* by indicating activities in the kitchen: 
 1. Click. Count how many times users click a button. 
 2. Sound. Count how many times there's a loud noise.  
 3. Light. Meausre the average light level.
